# Look at several Rails/Ruby online documentation sources and say 
# which one you like best and why.

# My favorite Ruby online documentation is docs.ruby-lang.org, because
# there is plenty of insight on the internet from more experienced 
# programmers on how to search and analyze the site quickly, and I also
# picked up how to follow the formatting of the site very quickly.
